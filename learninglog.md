* `:term` to enter terminal emulator mode
    * could be used to running something and easily copying some output
* `zz` to center cursor on the screen
* `{Visual}gq` to split long line for ease of editing
    * could be joined back by `J` (tried joining with `<num>J` so no need to hit J multiple times
* `t<char>` & `T<char>` - similar to `f<char>` and `F<char>` but jumps TILL the character
